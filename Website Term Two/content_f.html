Information regarding occupancy levels and distribution patterns of movement in buildings may follow different patterns based on special events or times of the day. The room occupancy may vary seasonally, with time of the day or even days of the weeks and holidays. For example, a living room occupancy pattern is usually higher during the day than during the night.

                                <p><b>B42Snapshot</b> stores the data that comes directly from the Arduino. It shows the transitions at a given door along with the confidence level, direction sign and timestamp of the event.
                                </p>
                                <p><b>BuildingPlan</b> lists all the doors in a building as well as their adjacent rooms. For this model we assume that a door is two sided. The transition is positive when it is from Room1 to Room2 and negative if it is from opposite direction.
                                </p>
                                <p><b>CurrentState</b> stores the number of people currently occupied a given room, along with a cumulative confidence level. This table is created to allow faster access to the current state of each room.
                                </p>
                                <p><b>RoomOccupancy</b> stores the past data for each room occupancy at a given moment. A parameter time interval is used, for example 1 day, 1 hour or 5 minutes depending on the people movement dynamic and the snapshot will be generated. This database will be updated during a period where there are no activities. For example, very late at night.
                                </p>
                                <p><b>OccupancyLevels</b> gives information about the crowdedness of each room. The values vary depending on the area of a room. The occupancy level is associated with a color. The values in Empty, Few, Several, Crowded present an upper bound for the level. Empty is always 0. For example if we have Few – 4, Several – 10, Crowded – 30, and we have green for Empty, yellow for Few, orange for several and red for Crowded and the system shows that there are 14 people in a room, it will have red label.</p>
                                <p><b>RoomParameters</b> is a system table that specifies various characteristics about the rooms. For example, one can store HVAC (heating regulation and air-conditioning) conditions about every room. Since there systems use a lot of energy, a demand driven control will be essential in minimising the energy consumption. The value parameter represents the number of people that should be in the room for a certain activity to start. The dates show the period that this activity is valid.</p>
                                <p><b>CheckPresence</b> stores the data that comes directly from the room sensors. It shows the presence (Yes/No) in a given room along with a device number, confidence and timestamp of measurement.</p>
                                <p><b>Check_WiFi</b> stores the data that comes directly from the Wi-Fi sensors. It shows the number of devices in a given room along with a device number and timestamp of measurement.
                                CorrectErr stores a correction transitions of error handling module. Structure and fields are same as of b42snapshot.</p>
                                <p><b>ForcedRules</b> is a table that specifies max and min people limits for the room at agiven period of a given day of week, typeofday (working or holiday), and flag for forcing rule. This is used by scheduled error correction procedure to enforce sets limit.</p>
                                <p><b>ConvexDefinitions</b> stores the parameters used in building and populating convex and convex_date tables. These parameters are ‘length in weeks in the past’ and ‘interval length to divide days (in seconds)’.</p>
                                <p><b>Convex_date</b> stores calculated history of a room’s occupancy in the defined weeks in the past in the form of min, max, average values per intervals of a days.</p>
                                <p><b>Convex</b> stores min, max and the average values of the room’s occupancy calculated per intervals of a weekday.</p>
                                <p>There are several helper views for facilitating queries and data processing procedures: <b>roommovements</b>, <b>camera_occupants</b> and <b>lastroomoccupancy</b>.</p>

It is the responsibility of the Test Manager to direct the development of system test plans and procedures, and conduct the system tests. Testing is performed to validate each component's ability to meet its stated requirements and to ensure interoperability of the major software components. System qualification testing is prepared to demonstrate to the client that system requirements have been met. It covers the system requirements agreed and written in the system requirements part.</p>

                                    <li>The Occupancy Engine <b>system receives data sent from different sensors</b> (door sensors, infrared room devices, Wi-Fi devices) using post method in http protocol. After format and logical validation all received data is stored in the database. Process diagrams are shown on Figure 4-6, Figure 4-7 and Fig 4-8. <br> </li>
                                    <li><b>Quantify the number of people</b> in each room of a selected building, after each transition based on the information coming from different sensors. <br></li>
                                    <li><b>Calculation of the confidence level</b> of the number of people in every room, based on the confidence, received from the door sensors. The idea is that the combined confidence level for a room is calculated by using all the confidence levels from each of the doors. We calculate this apriori confidence for the particular room using confidence for all doors which are connected to this room with the following formula: number of people who moved through particular door (in both directions) multiplied by the confidence for this door. This is summed for all doors that are connected to the particular room and finally divided by the number of all peoples moved in both directions through these doors. Thus we receive the confidence level for the given room. This is the apriori confidence for the room. When enough historical data is collected, the system can calculate the confidence level for a room using the historical data stored in the system and making the automatic corrections, made from the system for the doors, connected to the same room. <br></li>
                                    <li><b>Error Handling Module</b> - according to our client requirements, the system needs to be able to make automatic correction of the errors with very minimal human interactions.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>The error checking and correction procedures are executed after every transmission of the data to ensure that any errors or inconsistencies are identified and taken care of right away. After checking the received data, the system automatically makes all necessary error corrections. For example, if the current-state table says that there is negative number of people in the room, the system will make an automatic correction and the negative value will not be stored in the current-state table. However, this does not mean that these inconsistencies and errors are not recorded. They will be recorded in as a historical data that we can use for further analysis. All corrections that are automatically corrected by the system will also be stored in the error corrections log, that way we should gather statistics for the errors and the system could use this data later to update the confidence level automatically if the errors reoccur.</li>
                                            <li>Another checking procedure is scheduled at pre-set time at night. On the base of information from door sensors and room devices. This procedure checks and compares occupancy in the rooms with the pre-defined set of rules. Using these rules, the system will be able to determine any unusual activities in a room and correct them, tracing back to the entrance/exit of the building using breath first search algorithm and tracking back the transitions from that room all the way to the entrance using calculating path. Later on, when there are enough data for analyses, the system can then create its own set of rules. The system will make an automatic correction by doing a breath first search and tracking back the transitions from that room all the way to the entrance. The process flow diagram is shown on Figure 4-10.</li>

                                            <li>User define set of rules (model) which program to follow when checking for
                                            errors, to determine whether or not an error needs to be corrected and how it should be corrected. We decided to create rules for the maximum number of people that could be in a certain room at a certain time of the day. These numbers are currently predefined for each room in each building. Later on, the system could create its own set of rules on the base of historical data.</li>

                                <p>The first step is to build an inference machine for machine learning and occupancy prediction (i.e. based on neural network) consuming information from sensors, historical data for the building, correct errors history, a penalty function – based on initial predefined rules and extrapolated from room and Wi-Fi sensors along with error correcting data. To select a suitable approach, historic data might be analysed by “of-the-shelf” workbench for data analysis, data mining, computer learning and predictive modelling – for instance WEKA, ELKI, RapidMiner - just to mention some of available free open source platforms. The second step is to ensure that we have reliable results in an appropriate response time in case of big buildings and huge amount of historical data - by applying scalable decentralized algorithms and/or parallel computing. Here choice of model and platform depends of volume and dynamic of data – Apache Hadoop ￼ family of products look like good first choice for establishing ￼ environment to start with.</p>
